<h3> <center> Tactical IoT based Surveillance Bot </h3></center>

<p>For my senior year project, I designed, machined, integrated, and developed software for a Tactical IoT based Surveillance Bot. The bot was carefully designed for climbing stairs. It had an onboard firearm (toy gun), which is controllable over the net from a webpage from an authenticated remote desktop using a mouse â€” moving the mouse horizontally or vertically would move the firearm accordingly, just like in a first-person shooting game. Keyboard controls shall enable locomotion, speed of the robot, while also toggling laser and torch lights. 
Check out the SolidWorks design as well as a short demo here!!

<p style="text-align:left">The Tactical Bot was first designed in CAD, following which we machined the 20 guage aluminium sheets into a trapezoidal fashion. Thereafter, we drilled holes using CNC drill machines, which we programmed using CAM. The mount for the firearm was created by wood for lightness. All the skilled work was carried out under my leadership in the machine shop of my college. </p>
