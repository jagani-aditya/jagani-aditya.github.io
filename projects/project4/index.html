<h3> <center> Tactical IoT based Surveillance Bot </h3></center>

<p>For my senior year project, I designed, machined, integrated, and developed software for a Tactical IoT based Surveillance Bot. The bot was carefully designed for climbing stairs. It had an onboard firearm (toy gun), which is controllable over the net from a webpage from an authenticated remote desktop using a mouse â€” moving the mouse horizontally or vertically would move the firearm accordingly, just like in a first-person shooting game. Keyboard controls shall enable locomotion, speed of the robot, while also toggling laser and torch lights. 
Check out the SolidWorks design as well as a short demo here!!
