<h3> <center> Autonomous Underwater Vehicle </h3></center>

<p>Underwater Robots are used to explore inaccessible and extreme places like oceans and seas for data sampling, environment monitoring, surveillance, etc. However, undersea forces such as water currents make it a challenge for the robot to stabilize and instead get washed up in case of strong tides. I have devised a PID control system that would enable the AUV to hold its pre-set depth position as well as heading. I thoroughly enjoyed the fieldwork and pool tests we conducted to test the behavior of our controller. 
</p>


<p>Implementing the PID control system is tested independently in a tub before integrating the whole systems and testing it in the pool</p>

<p>The assembly of the Rover is a tedious task and usually takes a couple of days to complete. Hence, it is necesarry to test all sensors, and thrusters independently for calibration prior to integrating it in the Rover. Therefore, we tested the functionality of the thrusters by implementing a PID system wherein, we took refined Gyroscope readings as our feedback parameter. </p>

<p>The Rover consists of several electronic parts which need to be assembled meticulously before testing. Choosing the correct amperage batteries and ESC's to control the thrusters is a meticulous task. We have also created a Power Distribution Board to simplify connections. In order to control the Rover, we used Odroid XU4 as our main MCU. Additionally, we used a Arduino as our controller to achieve station keeping, which involves Depth Hold, Heading Stabilizer and Roll Stabilizer. </p>

<p>Extensive care has to be taken before dipping the rover in water. To prevent leakage, a layer of Epoxy is put in places where leakage into the hull is possible. Water-proofing the rover is an extremely crucial task and helps prevent the onboard circuitary from frying.</p>
