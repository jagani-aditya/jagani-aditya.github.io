<h3> <center> Humanoid Robot </h3></center>

<p>The Humanoid Robot is a 3D printed life-size robot whose design is similar to the Inmoov. The primary aim of developing the humanoid robot was to impart the physical as well as the mental traits of a human being. For instance, we imbibed perception algorithms that can not only recognize humans, maintain eye contact with them, but also respond well while conversing with a human. We are currently developing gaits for dynamic stability by imparting robust controllers using crucial mathematical concepts such as Kinematics, Dynamics, Controls, etc. 
We are excited to showcase our engineering at Asia’s Biggest Maker Gathering, ‘MakerMela’ held in January 2020. Check out our work here!!  
The foundation day of my college was visited by the Ex-Chairman of the HRD Ministry of India, who was quite impressed with the humanoid head.
