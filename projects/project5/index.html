<p>The on-campus aero-modeling team, Onyx, designs and manufactures RC planes. I was in the Electronics team in my junior year of college where I determined the on-board electronics needed for the airplane, such as types of propellers required, current and voltage of Li-Po batteries in accord with appropriate and compatible ESCâ€™s which would provide with the necessary lift and thrust, duration of flight, optimum payload capacity etc. Testing RC planes made out of Balsa and checking their performances was particularly exciting!! We participated in several competitions, which include the SAE Competition, Boeing National Competition, etc. 
I also made YouTube videos for my team, wherein I explained the calculations and electronics used for our airplanes. Check out our short movies here!
