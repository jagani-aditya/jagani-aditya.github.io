<p>The on-campus aero-modeling team, Onyx, designs and manufactures RC planes. I was in the Electronics team in my junior year of college where I determined the on-board electronics needed for the airplane, such as types of propellers required, current and voltage of Li-Po batteries in accord with appropriate and compatible ESCâ€™s which would provide with the necessary lift and thrust, duration of flight, optimum payload capacity etc. 
</p>  
<p>Testing RC planes made out of Balsa and checking their performances was particularly exciting!! We participated in several competitions, which include the SAE Competition, Boeing National Competition, etc. 
</p>
<p>  I also made YouTube videos for my team, wherein I explained the calculations and electronics used for our airplanes. Check out our short movies here!
