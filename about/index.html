			I recently graduated from K.J. Somaiya College of Engineering, Mumbai, India, and obtained a bachelor's degree in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering. </p> 
			<p>I am currently interning at Research Innovation Incubation Design Labs (RIIDL), where I collaborated with other Makers to build a Humanoid Robot from scratch under the direct supervision of Mr. Gaurang Shetty, CEO/ Chief Innovation Catalyst of RIIDL (Marked 50 Most Inspiring CEO's by Silicon India).</p> 
			<p>In association with The Marine Robotics Team (TMRT), I am developing navigation techniques for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle using Finite State Machines for the SAUVC Competition held in Singapore in April 2020.</p> 
			<p>My current interests lie in designing and building robotic solutions for complex, unpredictable, and continuously changing environments through robust control systems. I love field robotics and testing robots in uncertain environments!!</p> 
			<p>I also spend a considerate amount of time imagining and designing unique robotic solutions such as: </p>
