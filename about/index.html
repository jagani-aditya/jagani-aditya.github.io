		<div class="about">
			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I am a recent graduate currently interning at Research Innovation Incubation Design Labs (RIIDL) where I collaborated with other Makers to build a Humanoid Robot from scratch under the direct supervision of Mr. Gaurang Shetty (Marked 50 Most Inspiring CEOâ€™s by Silicon India).
			In association with The Marine Robotics Team (TMRT), I am developing navigation techniques for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle using Finite State Machines for the SAUVC Competition held in Singapore on April 2020.  
			My current interests lie in designing and building robotic solutions for complex, unpredictable and constantly changing environments through robust control systems. I love field robotics and testing robots in uncertain environments!! 
			I also spend a considerate amount of time imagining and designing totally unique robotic solutions such as this one!!

			I am currently learning Computational Fluid Dynamics and using those concepts to design, analyse numerical solutions and simulate a unique design that would significantly reduce drag by a significant amount in model rockets.
Trekking is an exhilarating way to physically challenge myself and test my limits. I thoroughly enjoy the positive energy, vibrations and perspective I get from these arduous and high-risk Himalayan treks.
