			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<img src="/images/somaiya.jpeg" alt="1"  style="width:8%; float: left; margin-left:10px; margin-right:25px">
			<p style="text-align: left;">  I recently graduated from K.J. Somaiya College of Engineering, Mumbai, India, and obtained a bachelor's degree in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering. </p>

			<p style="text-align: left;"> I am currently interning at Research Innovation Incubation Design Labs (RIIDL), where I collaborated with other Makers to build a Humanoid Robot from scratch under the direct  supervision of Mr. Gaurang Shetty, CEO/ Chief Innovation Catalyst of RIIDL (Marked 50 Most Inspiring CEO's by Silicon India).</p>

			<p style="text-align:left;">In association with The Marine Robotics Team (TMRT), I am developing navigation techniques for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle using Finite State Machines for the SAUVC Competition held in Singapore in April 2020.</p> 
<br>

			<p style="text-align: left;">My current interests lie in designing and building robotic solutions for complex, unpredictable, and continuously changing environments through robust control systems. I love field robotics and testing robots in uncertain environments!!</p>

			<p>I also spend a considerate amount of time imagining and designing unique robotic solutions. I am currently designing a rough terrain robotic vehicle inspired by a radial engine that can navigate complicated terrains. I have already made a 1-D design of the robotic vehicle and am working on 3-D design. My design attempts to reinvent the wheel for rough terrains. Stay tuned for updates!!   </p>

			<p>I recently began to learn the basics of Computational Fluid Dynamics to concepts to design, analyze numerical solutions, and simulate a unique design that would significantly reduce drag by a significant amount in model rockets.</p>

			<p>I find trekking an exciting way to challenge and test my physical limits. I thoroughly enjoy the positive energy, vibrations, and perspective I get from these arduous and high-risk Himalayan treks.</p>
