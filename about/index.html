			<p style="text-align:left;">In association with The Marine Robotics Team (TMRT), I am developing navigation techniques for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle using Finite State Machines for the SAUVC Competition held in Singapore in April 2020.</p> 
<br>

			<p style="text-align: left;">My current interests lie in designing and building robotic solutions for complex, unpredictable, and continuously changing environments through robust control systems. I love field robotics and testing robots in uncertain environments!!</p>

			<p>I find trekking an exciting way to challenge and test my physical limits. I thoroughly enjoy the positive energy, vibrations, and perspective I get from these arduous and high-risk Himalayan treks.</p>
